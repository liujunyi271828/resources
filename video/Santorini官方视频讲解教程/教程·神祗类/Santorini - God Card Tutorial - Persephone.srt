Persephone goddess of spring growth on

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:09,589
your opponent's turn if possible at

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,360
least one worker must move up that turn

4
00:00:09,589 --> 00:00:14,308
Persephone wants everyone to enjoy the

5
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:16,769
Sun though that's not always the best

6
00:00:14,308 --> 00:00:19,197
thing for her opponent while moving up

7
00:00:16,769 --> 00:00:21,118
tends to seem like a positive it's not

8
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,550
always in the direction someone needs to

00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:25,919
be heading by building tempting towers

10
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:28,288
to climb Persephone can stop hers from

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,299
being blocked once there's nowhere else

12
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:33,090
to climb though opponents are free to

13
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:35,010
move normally even down if they want so

14
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:38,840
keep them walking on the edge of spring

15
00:00:35,009 --> 00:00:38,839
while you leap into summer
