00:00:00,079 --> 00:00:06,359
Clio muse of history place a coin token

2
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:09,148
on the first three blocks your workers

3
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:11,700
build opponents treat spaces containing

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:14,579
coins as if they contain only a dome

5
00:00:11,699 --> 00:00:17,309
this means opponents can't build or move

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:19,469
into those blocks because Cleo's workers

7
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:21,687
aren't affected by the coins they may

8
00:00:19,469 --> 00:00:24,179
move into them freely or build on top of

9
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:26,368
them if she builds on top of a coin he

10
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:28,139
removes that coin from the game though

11
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:30,239
if that block was still one of the first

12
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,668
three you built you would get a coin is

13
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:35,038
normal claim your property in the city

14
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:38,479
early and use it to your advantage as

15
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:38,478
much as you can later
