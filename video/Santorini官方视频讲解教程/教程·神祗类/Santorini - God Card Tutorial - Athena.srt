Athena the goddess of wisdom after

00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:07,739
stepping up a level no other builders

00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:10,259
may step up a level until your next turn

00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:14,967
steps up a level on your opponent's next

6
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,649
turn none of their builders may step up

7
00:00:14,968 --> 00:00:19,437
a level although they may step
