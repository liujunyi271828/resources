00:00:00,589 --> 00:00:07,890
Zeus god of the sky during your build

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:10,919
your worker may build a block under

4
00:00:07,889 --> 00:00:12,539
itself as the ruler of Mount Olympus

5
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:15,388
Zeus knows how to get to the pinnacle

6
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:17,338
his workers know to and can make sure

7
00:00:15,388 --> 00:00:20,399
they're never stuck lower than they want

8
00:00:17,339 --> 00:00:22,379
to be any move can become a way up when

9
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:24,209
you can build on yourself so it'll be

10
00:00:22,379 --> 00:00:26,909
hard for your opponent to block you by

11
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,920
building too high just remember that the

12
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:30,929
workers must move first before building

13
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,960
under themselves so it can still get

14
00:00:30,928 --> 00:00:36,147
stuck if they can't move to win you must

15
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,309
move from the second level to the third

16
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:40,410
so building yourself up to the third

17
00:00:38,308 --> 00:00:42,838
level doesn't remember the game the

18
00:00:40,409 --> 00:00:45,288
skies are yours so take your place among

19
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,530
the heavens as often as you like

20
00:00:45,289 --> 00:00:48,529
