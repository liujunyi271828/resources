1
00:00:00,439 --> 00:00:10,650
why a goddess of fate during setup take

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:14,040
the map shield and fate token behind

3
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:16,169
your shield secretly select a 2x2 square

4
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:18,239
of fate spaces by placing your fate

5
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:21,150
token on the map when placing your

6
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:22,918
workers place three of your collar if an

7
00:00:21,149 --> 00:00:25,799
opponent's worker attempts to win by

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:28,889
moving into one of your fate spaces you

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,660
win instead choosing which spaces to

10
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,909
place your fate token on at the start

11
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:35,969
happens before setting up any workers

12
00:00:32,909 --> 00:00:38,519
and once it's placed can't be moved

13
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:40,919
so the Marais should try to guide the

14
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,979
opponent to attempt to win in the spaces

15
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,299
they selected but don't be too obvious

16
00:00:42,979 --> 00:00:48,358
you don't want to give your secrets away

17
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:50,098
boy ray can also win normally by moving

18
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:52,467
from the second to the third level and

19
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:55,199
can even do so in two spaces they select

20
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:57,180
it by the Fate token by playing with the

21
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:59,877
strings of faith your opponent will

22
00:00:57,179 --> 00:01:01,978
second-guess every chance for glory only

23
00:00:59,878 --> 00:01:02,338
to perhaps have it cut out from under

24
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:05,918
them

25
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,919
