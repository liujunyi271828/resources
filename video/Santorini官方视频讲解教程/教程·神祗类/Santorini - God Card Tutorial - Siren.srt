silent alluring seeming

2
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:08,888
during setup place the arrow token

3
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:10,960
beside the board and oriented in any of

4
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:13,870
the eight directions to indicate the

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,570
direction of the siren song during your

6
00:00:13,869 --> 00:00:18,638
move instead of moving you may force one

7
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:20,770
or more opponent workers one or two

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,890
spaces in the direction of the siren

9
00:00:20,769 --> 00:00:26,669
song two unoccupied spaces of any level

10
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:29,800
then build with either of your workers

11
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:32,320
let your song war your opponent to their

12
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:34,510
defeat after choosing a direction at

13
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,518
setup it now can't be changed for the

14
00:00:34,509 --> 00:00:38,049
rest of the match so make sure your

15
00:00:36,518 --> 00:00:40,448
opponent is clear on which direction

16
00:00:38,049 --> 00:00:42,787
that is just in case the token gets

17
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:45,009
bumped if an opponent worker would be

18
00:00:42,789 --> 00:00:47,499
forced into a space occupied by a dome

19
00:00:45,009 --> 00:00:49,988
or other worker it cannot be forced

20
00:00:47,499 --> 00:00:52,210
further you can force as many workers as

21
00:00:49,988 --> 00:00:54,247
the opponent has in the direction chosen

22
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:56,469
at the start but if you give up your

23
00:00:54,249 --> 00:00:59,378
movement you must force at least one of

24
00:00:56,469 --> 00:01:02,138
them one space if your opponent is ready

25
00:00:59,378 --> 00:01:04,358
to set sail to the top of Santorini sing

26
00:01:02,139 --> 00:01:06,629
them an alluring song and scuttle their

27
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:06,628
plans

28
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,939
