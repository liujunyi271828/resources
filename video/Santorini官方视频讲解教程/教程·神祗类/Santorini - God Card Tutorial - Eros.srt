00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,419
Aeolus god of desire during setup place

2
00:00:04,318 --> 00:00:08,909
your workers anywhere along opposite

3
00:00:06,419 --> 00:00:10,529
edges of the board you also win if one

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:12,870
of your workers moves to a space

5
00:00:10,529 --> 00:00:14,819
neighboring your other worker and both

6
00:00:12,869 --> 00:00:17,729
are on the first level for the same

7
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:20,010
level in a three-player game it's a tale

8
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:21,660
of lovers meeting in the middle who your

9
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:24,420
workers can meet anywhere on the first

10
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:26,910
level and win one block is all it takes

11
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:28,380

12
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:30,688
make sure to leave a lot of meat up

00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:33,058
opportunity by building level one blocks

14
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:35,280
towards your other worker and anything

15
00:00:33,058 --> 00:00:37,439
higher out of the way and don't forget

16
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,360

17
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:42,269
distance relationship isn't the end of

18
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:44,128
the world for eros love conquers all

19
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:47,699
which is going to make it hard for your

20
00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:50,757
opponent to keep the couple apart

00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,759
