1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,060
right god of the waves during our move

2
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:08,729
each time your worker moves into a

3
00:00:06,059 --> 00:00:11,818
perimeter space it may immediately move

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:14,039
again a quick jaunt in the ocean could

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:15,750
be the advantage you need as long as

6
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:18,149
your workers move into another parameter

7
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:20,309
space they can continue to move around

8
00:00:18,149 --> 00:00:22,527
the island the only thing that stops

9
00:00:20,309 --> 00:00:24,538
them is normal move restriction like

10
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:27,149
only being able to move up one level at

11
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:29,519
a time and not being able to move on to

12
00:00:27,149 --> 00:00:31,828
a dome you don't always have to take the

13
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:34,529
extra move so you can end up anywhere

14
00:00:31,829 --> 00:00:36,928
along the coast you want or use a final

15
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,730
move to get back to the middle getting

16
00:00:36,929 --> 00:00:42,049
to where you want is easy when you can

17
00:00:38,729 --> 00:00:42,048
just ride in on the waves
