limas goddess of famine during your

00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:08,308
opponent's turn opponent workers cannot

3
00:00:06,028 --> 00:00:10,798
build on spaces neighboring your workers

4
00:00:08,308 --> 00:00:14,368
unless building a dome to create a

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,378
complete tower Lee missus hunger follows

6
00:00:14,369 --> 00:00:18,899
her workers around like a dark arm

7
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:21,630
creating a void zone where only limas

8
00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:23,339
can build each turn use limas to block

9
00:00:21,629 --> 00:00:25,438
your opponent's attempts to create a

10
00:00:23,339 --> 00:00:27,659
high enough tower to climb up just by

11
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,849
being in the area if you can prevent

them from building at all they also lose

the game you'll have to rely on your own

14
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:36,208
builds to move yourself up in the city

15
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:38,939
since your opponent won't be able to

00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:40,860
build a step up for you remember they

17
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:43,049
can still finish towers you're trying to

18
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:45,179
get to the top o with domes so don't

19
00:00:43,049 --> 00:00:48,129
starve them too much or they'll never

20
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:51,188
leave you alone to sneak in your victory
