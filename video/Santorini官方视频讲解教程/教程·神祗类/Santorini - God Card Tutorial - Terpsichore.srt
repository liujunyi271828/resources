2
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:08,249
terpsichore news of dancing on your turn

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:11,159
all of your workers must move and then

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:12,750
all must build your workers move and

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,690
build together in a whirlwind

6
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:18,179
performance both workers must move first

7
00:00:15,689 --> 00:00:20,399
before ID building but do get to move

8
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:22,679
one after the other if one happens to be

9
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:25,009
in the other's way then both get to

10
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:27,358
build once again one after the other

11
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:29,038
meaning if they are close enough it

12
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,528
could build one block on top of the

13
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,870
other they just built because your

14
00:00:31,528 --> 00:00:36,508
workers must dance this way if either of

15
00:00:33,869 --> 00:00:38,577
them can't move or can't build when they

16
00:00:36,509 --> 00:00:41,009
are supposed to you lose the game as

17
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:43,378
normal build the city to the beat of the

18
00:00:41,009 --> 00:00:45,919
drum and soon you'll be twirling in the

19
00:00:43,378 --> 00:00:45,918
spotlight
