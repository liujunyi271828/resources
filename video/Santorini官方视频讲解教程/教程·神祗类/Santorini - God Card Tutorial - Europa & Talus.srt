Europa and Tallis Queen and Guardian

2
00:00:04,169 --> 00:00:10,048
otamatone cheering set up place the

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,820
Tallis token on your god power card at

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:14,130
the end of your turn you may relocate

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,698
your Tallis token to any unoccupied

6
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:18,538
space neighboring the worker that moved

7
00:00:16,699 --> 00:00:20,609
at any time

8
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:23,069
all players treat the space containing

9
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:26,820
the Tallis token as if it contains only

10
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:29,400
a dome let Tallis guard what you

11
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,409
normally can't after moving in building

12
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:33,359
with one of your Rochas workers they can

13
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:36,270
summon Tallis to protect themselves for

14
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:38,729
opponents Tallis cannot be moved to or

15
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:41,250
built on so is good at getting in your

16
00:00:38,729 --> 00:00:43,498
opponent's way he can be summoned from

17
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:45,809
anywhere on the island or from your god

18
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,700
card when you need him and he can even

19
00:00:45,808 --> 00:00:50,248
be some into the block you've just built

20
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:52,140
if you like where he is you can just

21
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,570
have him stay there and guard that space

22
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,1000
as well even if your worker moved away

23
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:59,219
just remember Tallis gets in your way

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,410
too so don't leave him somewhere you

25
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:04,049
need to be as he won't be able to move

26
00:01:01,409 --> 00:01:06,328
until after your workers ever-vigilant

27
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:10,459
Europa's Guardian will always have her

28
00:01:06,329 --> 00:01:10,458
back while she sits atop her Palace

29
00:01:10,829 --> 00:01:13,547
