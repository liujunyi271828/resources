00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:07,619
Prometheus Titan benefactor of mankind

2
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:09,928
on your turn if your worker does not

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:13,200
move up it may build both before and

4
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:15,690
after moving the worker that builds has

5
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:17,309
to be the same worker that moves so both

6
00:00:15,689 --> 00:00:19,229
blocks would have to come from that

7
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:21,509
worker when using prometheus

8
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,680
if you need to block your opponent in

9
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,199
two places at once

10
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:27,839
look for an opening to build once move

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,449
away then build again covering a large

12
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:32,339
distance of the island while you can't

13
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:34,920
move up if you wish to build before you

14
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,899
move you can still jump down so don't be

15
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:40,519
afraid to give up on a tower you won't

16
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:40,520
get to go work on another
