1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:06,660
para goddess of marriage on your

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:09,900
opponent's turn an opponent cannot win

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:11,519
by moving into a parameter space for

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,799
your opponent to get married they must

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,780
do so in the temple in this case the

6
00:00:13,798 --> 00:00:18,118
temple is one of the nine Center squares

7
00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:19,649
of the island Hera's opponent may still

8
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:22,138
move up to the third level on a

9
00:00:19,649 --> 00:00:24,568
parameter space but will not win the

10
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,789
game by doing so so don't bother putting

11
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,768
down domes you don't need to your

12
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:31,229
opponent can still move from a parameter

13
00:00:28,768 --> 00:00:32,878
space to win just not to one so they

14
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:35,489
shouldn't lock themselves to the middle

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,380
either wedding bells will ring just make

16
00:00:35,488 --> 00:00:40,039
sure it's yours that time out over the

17
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,040
city first
