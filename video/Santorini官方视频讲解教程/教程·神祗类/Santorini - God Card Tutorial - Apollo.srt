00:00:00,469 --> 00:00:07,560
Apollo god of music your worker may move

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:09,990
into an opponent workers space by

3
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:13,137
forcing their worker to the space yours

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:15,209
vacated effectively this allows the

5
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:17,878
Apollo player to swap locations with a

6
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:19,889
neighboring opponents worker all those

7
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:21,839
workers still follows all rules for

8
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:24,600
moving such as only being able to move

9
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:26,728
up one level or other God's restrictions

10
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,830
because the opponent's workers being

11
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:31,348
forced into the space Apollo left

12
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:34,019
movement restrictions do not apply to

13
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:36,238
them when our opponents on stage and

14
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:41,090
ready to win steal the spotlight from

15
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:41,089
them to sing your own serenade a victory
