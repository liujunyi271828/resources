1
00:00:00,469 --> 00:00:06,209
Hiep miss god of sleep during your

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,220
opponent's turn if one of your

3
00:00:06,209 --> 00:00:10,728
opponent's workers is higher than all of

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:13,529
their others it cannot move

5
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:15,718
everyone needs a good rest after a hard

6
00:00:13,529 --> 00:00:18,179
day's work while your opponent's workers

7
00:00:15,718 --> 00:00:20,788
are on the same level either of them may

8
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:22,379
move so a worker that does more climbing

9
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:25,050
than the others is gonna have to take a

10
00:00:22,379 --> 00:00:28,048
break until the others catch up a worker

11
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:29,609
that can't move also can't build so your

12
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:33,090
opponent should get them on even footing

13
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:34,860
as soon as possible if not well it's not

14
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,700
your problem if your opponent is

15
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:37,698
sleeping on the job
