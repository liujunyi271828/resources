00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:08,249
hermÃ¨s God have traveled on your turn if

2
00:00:05,429 --> 00:00:10,799
your workers do not move up or down then

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:14,250
we each move any number of times even

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,619
zero and then either builds if you do

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:18,149
plan to move up or down on a turn you

6
00:00:16,618 --> 00:00:20,969
must move and build normally with a

7
00:00:18,149 --> 00:00:23,038
single worker your workers don't need to

8
00:00:20,969 --> 00:00:24,959
be on the same level when using Hermes

9
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,119
but each must stay on the same level

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,250
they started on they can never move up

11
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:31,858
or down even if they would end their

12
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:34,379
turn on the same level they can also

13
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:36,809
choose not to move but one of them must

14
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:39,149
build when your workers don't like where

15
00:00:36,808 --> 00:00:42,088
they are - them into a better position

16
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:44,750
then build yourself a perfect reason to

17
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:44,750
step up
