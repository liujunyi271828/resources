1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:06,720
the fastest god of blacksmiths when you

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:09,780
build your worker may build one

3
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:12,869
additional block not dome on top of your

4
00:00:09,779 --> 00:00:15,807
first block stack of high is a Festus is

5
00:00:12,869 --> 00:00:17,909
motto after building on your turn you

6
00:00:15,808 --> 00:00:20,819
may build a second block on top of it

7
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:23,429
because this extra block can't be a dome

8
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,289
if you build the third level block as

9
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:28,347
your first block you can't build a

10
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:29,910
second on that turn tall building is

11
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:31,470
just as good as a dome when your

12
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,840
opponent can't climb it

13
00:00:31,469 --> 00:00:36,799
so hammer out those blocks when they at

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,800
least expect it
