00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:07,648
Urania muse of astronomy on your turn

3
00:00:05,099 --> 00:00:10,137
when your worker moves her builds treat

4
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:12,509
opposite edges and corners as if they

5
00:00:10,138 --> 00:00:15,628
are adjacent so that every space has

6
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:18,480
eight neighbors traverse the stars to

7
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:20,309
arrive at your desired destination when

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,649
one of your workers moves off the side

9
00:00:20,309 --> 00:00:24,929
of the board they appear on the opposite

10
00:00:22,649 --> 00:00:27,299
edge of or corner they must still follow

11
00:00:24,929 --> 00:00:29,278
normal move restrictions however so you

12
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,979
couldn't work from a ground-level space

13
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:34,319
to a level 2 tower but could still win

14
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,930
if warping from a level 2 tower to a

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,058
third-level tower because building works

16
00:00:36,929 --> 00:00:40,948
in the same way you can surprise your

17
00:00:39,058 --> 00:00:42,627
opponent by building where it looked

18
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:45,570
like you could never be able to reach

19
00:00:42,628 --> 00:00:48,129
use the night sky as your roadmap so

20
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:51,188
you'll never get lost
