Eero ferryman to the underworld before

2
00:00:04,469 --> 00:00:08,818
your worker moves you may force a

3
00:00:06,809 --> 00:00:10,828
neighboring opponent worker to the space

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:13,308
directly on the other side of your

5
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:15,870
worker if that space is unoccupied

6
00:00:13,308 --> 00:00:17,998
because this happens before your move

7
00:00:15,869 --> 00:00:20,037
there's no reason you have to move into

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,589

00:00:24,809 --> 00:00:29,608
onto the appropriate space the matter

00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:32,368
its level as long as it's unoccupied by

13
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:34,620
a dome or another worker fairy your

14
00:00:32,368 --> 00:00:38,238
opponent away from their goal and be on

00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:38,238
your merry way towards yours
