00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,540
Gaea goddess of the earth when a worker

2
00:00:03,569 --> 00:00:08,759
builds a dome Gaea may immediately place

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,019
a worker from her god called on to a

4
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:12,328
ground-level space

5
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:14,280
neighboring the dome Gaea starts the

6
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:16,980
game with two extra workers of her color

7
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:19,229
on her card when Gaia or an opponent

8
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,910
places a dome if there's at least one or

9
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,589
more unoccupied ground spaces

10
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:24,449
neighboring it the Gaea player decides

11
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:26,608
which neighbor and ground space to place

12
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:28,590
the extra worker in this new worker

13
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:30,990
becomes available for Gaea to use on

14
00:00:28,589 --> 00:00:33,688
subsequent turns Gaia can have a maximum

15
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:35,758
of four workers on the board for so many

16
00:00:33,689 --> 00:00:39,708
extra workers around it won't be easy to

17
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:39,709
stop one of them from getting to the top
