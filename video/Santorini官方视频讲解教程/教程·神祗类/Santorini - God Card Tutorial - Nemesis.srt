00:00:00,469 --> 00:00:06,358
nemesis goddess of retribution at the

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:08,638
end of your turn if none of an

4
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:10,500
opponent's workers neighbor yours you

5
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:12,838
may force as many of your opponent's

6
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,198
workers as possible to take the spaces

7
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:17,549
you occupy and vice versa

8
00:00:15,198 --> 00:00:19,879
what was once your enemies will become

9
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:22,199
yours when drawing on nemesis is power

10
00:00:19,879 --> 00:00:23,548
because her ability comes at the end of

11
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:25,380
the turn you'll have plenty of

12
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,179
opportunity to set up for it

13
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:28,968
just make sure that neither of your

14
00:00:27,179 --> 00:00:31,889
workers are neighboring one of theirs

15
00:00:28,969 --> 00:00:33,449
when you do an actual retribution you

16
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,700
must swap both of your workers with

17
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:38,070
fairs for good or bad you can't pick

18
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:40,350
only one pair of workers to swap it must

19
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:42,058
be both if your opponent has an

20
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:44,699
advantage put yourself at a disadvantage

21
00:00:42,058 --> 00:00:47,158
and then take it all away from them

22
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:50,469
retribution is a dish best served from

23
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:53,498
the top of Santorini
