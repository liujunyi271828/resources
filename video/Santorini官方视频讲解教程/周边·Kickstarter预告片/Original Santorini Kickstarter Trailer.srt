1
00:00:03,129 --> 00:00:10,758
deep in the heart of the Aegean Sea a

2
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:12,679
long time ago before you and me when the

3
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:16,669
gods of the Pantheon did not yet have

4
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:19,118
fame they met in the ocean and invented

5
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:19,118
the game

6
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,099
the top Mount Olympus you sat on his

7
00:00:24,059 --> 00:00:27,849
throne

8
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:29,920
and none of his children

9
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:32,829
so he commanded the teens in a

10
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:35,700
thunderous toad the immortal kids go

11
00:00:32,829 --> 00:00:39,059
outside and leave me alone

12
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:42,309
but Zeus was unaware of what he implored

13
00:00:39,058 --> 00:00:43,029
as mr. vis a product of a God who is

14
00:00:42,308 --> 00:00:46,029
bored

15
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:49,570
ere is seen lot of hues to regard him as

16
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:53,829
Lord and since Spartan and Trojan to die

17
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:57,039
by the soul water until on the horizon

18
00:00:53,829 --> 00:01:00,398
he eventually spied an extremely tall

19
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:02,439
island that was not very wide some

20
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:05,709
pathetic humans are building a village

21
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:06,868
was a great opportunity to go over and

22
00:01:05,709 --> 00:01:09,939
pillage

23
00:01:06,868 --> 00:01:13,058
but Aphrodite stopped him and decided to

24
00:01:09,939 --> 00:01:15,879
ask why must you always make destruction

25
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:18,250
your task instead let us help them build

26
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:21,218
this wonderful city destroying those

27
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:22,658
domes would be a terrible pity you guide

28
00:01:21,219 --> 00:01:25,478
them your way

29
00:01:22,659 --> 00:01:28,328
I'll guide the mine so we can both help

30
00:01:25,478 --> 00:01:30,548
them finish these temples divine when

31
00:01:28,328 --> 00:01:32,738
one of our towers rises above all the

32
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:35,259
rest we shall see you can help these

33
00:01:32,739 --> 00:01:37,599
humans better than the best so they

34
00:01:35,259 --> 00:01:40,270
constructed quite quickly using builders

35
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:42,808
to claim the highest point on the island

36
00:01:40,269 --> 00:01:44,547
for their own God

37
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:46,920
each of the guards have their own

38
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:48,989
special powers they use to their

39
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:51,379
advantage while erecting their towers

40
00:01:48,989 --> 00:01:53,538
upon realizing at a point

41
00:01:51,379 --> 00:01:55,489
could be predicted these gods couldn't

42
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:58,639
help it they were completely addicted

43
00:01:55,489 --> 00:01:59,668
there he said what fun let us give this

44
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,909
a name

45
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:07,580
you smoke from above we shall call it a

46
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:07,580
game so they've in century

47
00:02:07,989 --> 00:02:12,987
by shaping the force of those women

48
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:14,859
and each time they built it it was never

49
00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:18,360
the same

50
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:18,360
he's had to smash it

51
00:02:18,389 --> 00:02:22,749
zoos really so the kids for the best bad

52
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:24,789
son

53
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:26,379
they no longer stared at the boobs just

54
00:02:24,789 --> 00:02:28,808
getting done

55
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:31,228
so next time you wonder which game came

56
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:31,229
before

57
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:34,260
century

58
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:43,207
since its inception over 30 years ago

59
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:44,860
Santorini has been continuously enhanced

60
00:02:43,209 --> 00:02:47,500
and refined by mathematician and

61
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:49,510
educator dr. Gordon Hamilton Santorini

62
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,859
is a highly accessible pure strategy

63
00:02:49,509 --> 00:02:52,808
game it is simple enough for an

64
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:54,580
elementary school classroom but with

65
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:56,200
enough gameplay depth and content for

66
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:58,830
even hardcore gamers to explore

67
00:02:56,199 --> 00:03:01,987
Santorini is truly a game for everyone

68
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:03,790
the rules are deceptively simple each

69
00:03:01,989 --> 00:03:06,128
turn move one of your builders into a

70
00:03:03,789 --> 00:03:07,808
neighboring space then construct a

71
00:03:06,128 --> 00:03:10,658
building level adjacent to the door be

72
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:13,109
removed you may step up a maximum of one

73
00:03:10,659 --> 00:03:15,458
level or step down any number of levels

74
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:17,799
when building on top of the third level

75
00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:20,229
place it to him instead removing that

76
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:22,709
space from play if either of your

77
00:03:20,229 --> 00:03:25,208
builders reaches the third level you win

78
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:27,459
Santorini features 68 highly detailed

79
00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:29,048

miniatures and a custom-designed

81

elevated iron play surface creating the

82
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:36,547
beautiful 3d tabletop experience but

83
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,319
what makes Santorini truly special is

84
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:40,568
its seamless integration of variable

85
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:42,879
player panels into a pure strategy game

86
00:03:40,568 --> 00:03:45,098

87
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:47,018
thematic garden hero powers each

88
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:49,207

is played your contribution to the

90
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:52,870
project will help unlock various stretch

91
00:03:51,009 --> 00:03:54,939
goals further improving the component

92
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:57,009

unlocking a pantheon of new god and hero

94
00:03:57,009 --> 00:04:01,839
powers each adding significant replay

95
00:03:59,349 --> 00:04:03,578
value by potentially creating over 1,000

96
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,199
interesting and unique confrontations

97
